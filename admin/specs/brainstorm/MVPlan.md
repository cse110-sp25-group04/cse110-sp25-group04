<h1>MVP Plan:</h1>
<h3>The following requirements will be done roughly in the given order </h3>

<ol>
  <li>Static <i>nxn</i> grid which contains rectangles of size <i>ixj</i> </li>
  <li>Drag-drop and Snap feature for cards to the grid (rectangles must not change shape)</li>
  <li>Apply callback functions to any (x,y) positions in the grid</li>
  <li>Launch callbacks automatically in a timer system</li>
  <li>Apply events through mouse clicks</li>
  <li>Queue the invents in a way to make interactions consistant</li>
  <li>Card selection process:
    - Fade background and make it uninteractable
    - Display three cards the player can choose from
    - Once player chooses one, back to the game
  </li>
  <li>Work on environment mechanics (discussed further later)</li>
</ol>
