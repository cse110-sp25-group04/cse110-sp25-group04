# Issue Tracking

## Reasoning:

We found that it is very helpful to have all our necessities be stored in one place,
we chose this place to be our Slack channel.

## Application:

The first place is **Github** itself, within our repo.
Additionally however, we will place issues into a table on **Slack**.

In this table we will store the name, completion status (true/false), assignees, due date and 
most importantly, the **link** to the Github issue itself.
