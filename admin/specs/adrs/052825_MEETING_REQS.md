# Meeting Requirements

## Reasoning:

As things pick up and people work on more and more features and tasks, there will be much to talk about from the group.
Hence, we noticed that our group needs a standard meeting procedure and document to follow.

## Sections of meeting:

### Date: Simply the date the meeting is taking place

### Participants: Listing all participants who attended the meeting

### Progress: Standups

Since we have meetings quite often (twice a week,) since we have a backlog system with priorities for the tasks,
we will always talk about the tasks which are in the "In Progress" seciton of the project.

Other tasks, done my the team, wether not directly an issue, or an issue in the backlog will be brought up as teammates
note their work on these tasks.

**Blockers:** As each teammate does their standup, they will also note their blockers and we will keep track of them in
the meeting notes

### Planning: What is coming next

### Concerns: Concerns about the future or other questions

### Summary: A quick summary of progress and future plans
