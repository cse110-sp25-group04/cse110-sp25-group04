# Roles:

## Reasoning:
The reason for 2 split teams of developers is to be able to work on multiple small
features, or otherwise, produce multiple versions of a similar product to allow for
choices of adaptation.

We found that our individual knowledge is not enough to completely separate out
**Frontend** and **Backend** teams since we are not familiar with how the APIs
connect. In this format, since both teams have developers for both back and front
end, we will learn the entire stack much better.

We need a Lead Designer who will work closely with the leader and assistant to
create very descriptive and detailed design documentation using **Figma**, **Miro**
and other tools as necessary.

The teams may also need to work together as necessary.
