# Backlog System

## Reasoning: 
We found that our team was moving slightly too slowly and being unaware of future tasks was a major part of this. As a result, 
we came up with a system of storing a backlog of GitHub issues that we must work on. We also noticed that some of the tasks are very small,
yet some are full fledged features.

## Application:
We store these issues in Projects/Carden, in the Backlog tab, where we store issues that still must be done, in the TODO tab,
issues that are high prority and that we are working on now, in the "In Progress" section and the major tasks which were completed
in the "Done" section.
