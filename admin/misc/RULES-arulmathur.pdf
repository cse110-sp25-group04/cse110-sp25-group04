# Team 4 The Win - Group Contract

## Purpose and Objectives:

- Make a portfolio worthy project
- Stand out
- Learn how to work collaboratively
- Land an internship with experience gathered in this course

## Team Values:

- **Responsibility** in our work
- **Punctuality** in communication
- **Transparency** with issues
- **Respect** each other's work, time and differences
- **Adapt** to changes as they come

## Roles:

#### Logistical:

- Meruj: Team Leader
- Arman: Asset Acquisition and Assistant
- Eve: Lead Designer
- Richard and Mo: Testing and DevOps

#### Programming:

- Team 1:
    - Ali: Front end with html and css
    - Jude, Kyle: Back end developers with javascript

- Team 2:
    - Xiao: Front end with html and css
    - Arul, Eric: Back end developers with javascript

## Rules:

- A soft submission deadline is by 9 pm of the day of submission
- Meruj may not be available past 9 pm, so questions and issues must be reported before then
- In the case of an emergency submission Arman will step in, and if unavailable
- Meruj will do the submission past 9 pm only in the case of severe emergencies
- Absence and other problems must be reported in the **#All Excuses** slack channel

## Meetings:

There will be meetings every Tu/Th where required attendees will be 
made clear in the **#announcements** channel


## Issues & Resolution:

- If an issue must be complete, but the assigned person is unavailable
    - Meruj will be informed by other team members or know directly
    - Someone with less work will take over the issue to the best of their ability
    - If no one else is able to do so, the team will have to do more work
    - If not a team role, someone else will be assigned
    - If everyone else has been assigned a lot of work,
        Meruj will step in and try to catch things up

- If someone is constantly unavailable to the team when needed, 
- Or if someone is slacking on their work or completely unwilling to do it,
- Or if there is toxic behavior such as (blaming, shaming or scapegoating),
- Or if someone does not respond in a timely manner all the time,

**The issue will be raised to the TA relating to that person**

## Communication Channels:

- The two programming teams have Slack channels of their own
- Other single member roles can communicate with the team at any point, 
    or with Meruj directly
- All slack channels are open to everyone, but writing permission is limited

## DevOps:

- We use Jest as our testing framework and set up a linting process
- We use Github issues + a table of issues in slack for ease of tracking
