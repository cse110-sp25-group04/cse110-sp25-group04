## Summary
For our spring planning meeting we went over this week's assignments for the group project. We went over the coding standards we want to follow for the project to make it easier for everyone. We also went over the group contract where we dicussed all the points mentioned in the assignment and as a group made decisions as to how we view our group and our future goals for the project. Then we went over what our ADRs should be for this weeks submission and at the end of the meeting, we went over what is left to do and decided to finish the CI/CD Pipeline discussion on Thursday.
