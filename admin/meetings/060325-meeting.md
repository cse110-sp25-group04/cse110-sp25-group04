## ✅ Progress of the Week (Standups)

### 🔊 Speaker: Arul
- **What they’ve done:**  
  Cleaned up the code to make things more modular and easier to work with. Moved a lot of values into constants so they’re easier to manage. The board is now the main source of truth, with functions to create, clear, and load levels onto it. Also added the ability to move between levels smoothly.

- **What needs to be done:**  
  [Next steps or upcoming tasks]

### 🔊 Speaker: Xiao
- **What they’ve done:**  
  Fixed horizontal resizing bug so that the board and cardholder don't break and stay within window size.

### 🔊 Speaker: Ali
- **What they’ve done:**  
  On vertical screens made the card box go to the right of the part of the screen so everything fits in the window frame.

### 🔊 Speaker: Eve
- **What they’ve done:**  
  Created main view of board as well as popups when levels are cleared.

### 🔊 Speaker: Arman
- **What they’ve done:**  
  Created basic card assets with sample flower designs and backgrounds

## ⚠️ Blockers & Concerns

1. Need to work on menu and level select pages
2. Ensure that everything remains organized and it is clear who is working on what issue so there are no conflicts

## 📅 Planning: What’s Coming Up Next

1. Art team meeting to go over acquiring more assets and ideas for the visual part of the game
2. Work on resizing issues, specifically vertical resizing. Once bug is fixed frontend team write supporting document explaining what sizes work well and what sizes caused bugs
3. Frontend team plugging in art assets ensuring that there are no bugs
4. Testing team needs to try out different browsers and make a writeup
5. Work on transition animations as well as sound effects when playing cards/victory/loss, etc
6. Work on end of game page
