## Summary

We had our second meeting after everyone had the opportunity to share their ideas on the Miro document. As a group, we reviewed all the submissions, discussed them in detail, and voted on the idea we wanted to move forward with. After taking a group vote, we decided to continue developing the **Garden game** concept from the Miro document.

We also spent time discussing how we would approach creating our starting pitch document now that we have a clear direction. Together, we outlined what key points need to be included, how to organize the information, and made sure everyone is aligned on next steps.
