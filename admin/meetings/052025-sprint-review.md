## Summary
For this meeting, we reviewed our progress for the first sprint. Specifically, we discussed how there are still some bugs to work out in the animations that coding team 2 implemented. Additionally, we   highlighted how team 1 successfully implemented storing the game state of the board. As there is no game logic yet, the testing team members have been split into the two coding groups to provide support while we complete the basic functionality of the game. We also shared ideas on potentially drawing up some future levels to implement and the design for how the actual website will look.

## TODO:
**Team 1:**
- Fix animation bug where invalid placement outside the game boards results in the card returning to the wrong starting position

**Team 2:**
- Generate a random board
- Being able to change the logic behind the board so that placing a card changes the backend game state
